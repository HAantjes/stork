bin/ contains the executables, navigate in your terminal to this folder and execute the scripts, see also the readme of this folder
ihex/ contains the ccs files that wisent uses to program a wisp wireless
sllurp/ contains all the python files, see the readme of that folder
compression/ contains all code to create a compressed data file, which the CRFID can decompress (after receiving it via Stork). See the readme of that folder

don't ask about the setup.cfg and setup.py, see manual of sllurp for that

MOST IMPORTANT file in these folders: "bin/wControl" which depends on "sllurp/WControl.py" when running "bin/wControl" you will enter the WISP control environment and you can read write to WISPs wireless and even reprogram, boot, do decompression, clear memory
